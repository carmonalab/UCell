\title{UCell: Robust and scalable single-cell gene signature scoring}
\description{
UCell is an R package for scoring gene signatures in single-cell datasets.
UCell scores, based on the Mann-Whitney U statistic, are robust to dataset
size and heterogeneity, and their calculation demands relatively less
computing time and memory than most other methods, enabling the processing
of large datasets (> \eqn{10^5} cells). UCell can be applied to any cell
vs. gene data matrix, and includes functions to directly interact with
Seurat and SingleCellExperiment objects.
}
\section{UCell functions}{

\itemize{
\item \code{ScoreSignatures_UCell} Calculate module enrichment scores
from single-cell data. Given a gene vs. cell matrix (either as sparse
matrix or stored in a SingleCellExperiment object), it calculates
module/signature enrichment scores. This score depends only on the
gene activity ranks of individual cell, and therefore is robust across
datasets.
\item \code{AddModuleScore_UCell} A wrapper for UCell to interact
directly with Seurat objects. Given a Seurat object and a set of
signatures, it calculates enrichment scores on single-cell level
and returns them into the meta.data of the input Seurat object.
\item \code{StoreRankings_UCell} Calculates and stores gene rankings
for a single-cell dataset. Given a gene vs. cell matrix and a set of
signatures, it calculates the rankings of expression for all genes in
each cell. It can then be applied to the function ScoreSignatures_UCell
to evaluate gene signatures on the gene expression ranks of individual
cells.
\item \code{SmoothKNN} Perform signature score smoothing using a
weighted average of the scores of the first k nearest neighbors (kNN).
It can be useful to 'impute' scores by neighboring cells and partially
correct data sparsity. While this function has been designed to smooth
UCell scores, it can be applied to any numerical metadata contained in
SingleCellExperiment or Seurat objects

\section{Gene signatures}{

UCell evaluates the strength of gene signatures (or gene sets) in individual
cells of your dataset. You may specify positive and negative
(up- or down-regulated) genes in signatures. See the examples below:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{markers <- list()
markers$Tcell_CD4 <- c("CD4","CD40LG")
markers$Tcell_CD8 <- c("CD8A","CD8B")
markers$Tcell_Treg <- c("FOXP3","IL2RA")
markers$Tcell_gd <- c("TRDC+", "TRGC1+", "TRGC2+", 
                      "TRDV1+","TRAC-","TRBC1-","TRBC2-")
markers$Tcell_NK <- c("FGFBP2+", "SPON2+", "KLRF1+",
                      "FCGR3A+", "CD3E-","CD3G-")
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

If you don't specify +/- for genes, they are assumed to be all as a positive
set. The UCell score is calculated as: \deqn{U = max(0, U^+ - w_{neg} * U^-)}
where \eqn{U^+} and \eqn{U^-} are respectively the UCell scores for the
positive and negative set, and \eqn{w_neg} is a weight on the negative set.
When no negative set of genes is present, \eqn{U = U^+}
