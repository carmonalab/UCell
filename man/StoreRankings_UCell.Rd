\title{Calculate and store gene rankings for a single-cell dataset}
\usage{
StoreRankings_UCell(
  matrix,
  maxRank = 1500,
  chunk.size = 1000,
  BPPARAM = NULL,
  ncores = 1,
  assay = "counts",
  ties.method = "average",
  force.gc = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{Input matrix, either stored in a \link{SingleCellExperiment} object
or as a raw matrix. \code{dgCMatrix} format supported.}

\item{maxRank}{Maximum number of genes to rank per cell; above this rank, a
given gene is considered as not expressed}

\item{chunk.size}{Number of cells to be processed simultaneously (lower size
requires slightly more computation but reduces memory demands)}

\item{BPPARAM}{A \code{\link[BiocParallel:register]{BiocParallel::bpparam()}} object that tells UCell
how to parallelize. If provided, it overrides the \code{ncores} parameter.}

\item{ncores}{Number of processors to parallelize computation. If
\code{BPPARAM = NULL}, the function uses
\code{BiocParallel::MulticoreParam(workers=ncores)}}

\item{assay}{Assay where the data is to be found (for input in 'sce' format)}

\item{ties.method}{How ranking ties should be resolved - passed on to
\link[data.table:frank]{data.table::frank}}

\item{force.gc}{Explicitly call garbage collector to reduce memory footprint}
}
\value{
Returns a sparse matrix of pre-calculated ranks that can be used
multiple times to evaluate different signatures
}
\description{
Given a gene vs. cell matrix, calculates the rankings of expression for all
genes in each cell.
}
\details{
While \code{\link{ScoreSignatures_UCell}} can be used 'on the fly' to
evaluate signatures in a query dataset, it requires recalculating gene
ranks at every execution. If you have a large dataset and plan to experiment
with multiple signatures, evaluating the same dataset multiple times,
this function allows you to store pre-calculated ranks so they do not have to
be recomputed every time. Pre-calculated ranks can then be applied to the
function \code{\link{ScoreSignatures_UCell}} to evaluate gene signatures in a
significantly faster way on successive iterations.

\examples{
library(UCell)
data(sample.matrix)
ranks <- StoreRankings_UCell(sample.matrix)
ranks[1:5,1:5]
gene.sets <- list( Tcell_signature = c("CD2","CD3E","CD3D"),
                 Myeloid_signature = c("SPI1","FCER1G","CSF1R"))
scores <- ScoreSignatures_UCell(features=gene.sets, precalc.ranks=ranks)
head(scores)
